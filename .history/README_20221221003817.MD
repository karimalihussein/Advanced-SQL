# Advanced SQL: introduction to MS SQL Server

## Introduction

This is a repository for the Advanced SQL course

## What is SQL?
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL is used to communicate with a database
- SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard
- SQL is the most popular database language today
- SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases

# What can SQL do?
- SQL can execute queries against a database

- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
- SQL can create indexes on tables
- SQL can create triggers on tables
- SQL can create user-defined functions in a database
- SQL can create user-defined aggregate functions in a database
- SQL can create user-defined data types in a database

# what is database mining?
- Database mining is the process of discovering patterns in large databases.
- Database mining is also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD).
- Database mining is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information - information that can be used to increase revenue, cuts costs, or both.
- Database mining is used by companies that want to market new products to their existing customers or by companies that want to attract new customers.
- Database mining is also used to determine which customers are likely to respond to a particular marketing campaign.

# Databse Objects
- Tables: A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
- Views: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
- Indexes: An index is a way to quickly locate data in a database.
- Triggers: A trigger is a set of SQL statements that are automatically executed when a specified event occurs in a database.
- Procedures: A procedure is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed by using a procedure name.
- Functions: A function is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed by using a function name.
- Cursors: A cursor is a database object that enables you to traverse the rows of a result-set one row at a time.
- Constraints: A constraint is a rule that is enforced on a column or a table.
- Rules: Specify acceptable values that can be entered into a table.
- Synonyms: A synonym is an alternative name for a database object.
- Packages: A package is a collection of database objects that can be stored in the database and reused in other packages or applications.
- Database Links: A database link is a connection to another database.
- Sequences: A sequence is a database object that generates a series of numbers.
- Types: A type is a collection of attributes that define the structure of a table.
- Domains: A domain is a collection of values that define the structure of a column.
- Operators: An operator is a symbol that tells the database how to perform a calculation.
- Expressions: An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that results in a value.
- Clusters: A cluster is a group of database objects that are stored together on disk.
# Authentication Methods
- Windows Authentication: Windows Authentication is a method of authentication that uses the Windows operating system to verify the identity of a user.
# Create a Data Model From gathered Requirements:
- Identify the entities
- Identify the relationships
- Identify the attributes of each entity
- Identify the primary key of each entity
- Identify the foreign key of each entity
- some concepts: 
1 - Entity: An entity is a person, place, object, or event about which data is stored.
2 - Attribute: An attribute is a characteristic of an entity.
3 - Relationship: A relationship is a connection between two or more entities.
4 - Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
5 - Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row/record in another table.
- some rules:
1 - Each entity must have a primary key.
2 - Each entity must have at least one attribute.

- Attributes can be:
1 - Single-valued: A single-valued attribute can have only one value for each entity.
2 - Multi-valued: A multi-valued attribute can have more than one value for each entity.
3 - Derived: A derived attribute is a value that is calculated from other values.
4 - Composite: A composite attribute is an attribute that is made up of other attributes.
5 - Derived and Composite: A derived and composite attribute is an attribute that is calculated from other attributes.
6 - Identifiers: An identifier is a unique value that identifies an entity.

# 1NF: stands for First Normal Form
- Rows contain data attributes of the relation
- Cells of the table hold a single value (no arrays)
- Column are attributes of the relation
- All entries in a column are of the same domain (physical and logical)
- Each attribute has a unique name
- No two tuples may be identical (must have a valid primary key)
- No repeating groups - more than one attribute from same physical and logical domain (ex. author1 author2, etc.)

# Crow's Foot Notation
- Crow's Foot Notation is a notation used to represent the relationships between tables in a database.
- Crow's Foot Notation is also known as Chen's Notation.
- Crow's Foot Notation is used to represent the relationships between tables in a database.

# Golden rules in database
- The database should be normalized to the highest possible level.
- The database should be designed to be as flexible as possible.
- The database should be designed to be as easy to use as possible.

# The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
- The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
- The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various objects on an existing table.

# Normalization DB with 2NF
- 2NF: stands for Second Normal Form
- 2NF: is a normal form used to normalize a database table.

# Why Normalization?
- Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.
- Normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
- Redundancy: infromation repeated in multiple locations
- Update: failure to change all instances of a specific value.
- Delete: delete data ane lose other values as side effect
- Insert [
    - need to add data about multiple themes into a relation
    - adding rows may force users to add infromation about another theme
]
# Functional Dependencies
- Functional Dependencies: is a relationship between two sets of attributes where changing the value of one set of attributes determines the value of the other set of attributes.
- A set of attributes can form a functional dependency: A,B,C → D, A,B,C → D does not mean A → D, BD, and C → D
- All three attributes are needed to determine the value of D
- A,B,C → D is a functional dependency

# Second Normal Form (2NF)
- A relation is in second normal form
  - if it is in first normal form and all of its non-key attributes are dependent on
the entire primary key
    example: book(ISBN,name,date_publish) ISBN->name,date_publish)

- Non-key attribute: attribute that is not part of the primary key
- A relation is in second normal form if it is in first normal form and all of its non-key attributes are dependent on the entire primary key.
- Dependent: Attributes appearing on the right side of a functional dependency
- Independent: Attributes appearing on the left side of a functional dependency
- Violation: partial dependency - when you have a non-key attribute that is dependent on only part of a composite pk (primary key)

```sql
-- book(ISBN, name,date_publish,authorname, address)
-- ISBN, authorname>name,date_publish,address)
-- authorname>address
CREATE TABLE books (
    ISBN VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_publish DATE NOT NULL,
    authorname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ISBN)
);

CREATE TABLE authors (
    authorname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (authorname)
);

INSERT INTO books VALUES ('1234567890', 'The C Programming Language', '1978-02-22', 'Dennis Ritchie', 'USA');
