- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
- SQL can create indexes on tables
- SQL can create triggers on tables
- SQL can create user-defined functions in a database
- SQL can create user-defined aggregate functions in a database
- SQL can create user-defined data types in a database

# what is database mining?
- Database mining is the process of discovering patterns in large databases.
- Database mining is also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD).
- Database mining is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information - information that can be used to increase revenue, cuts costs, or both.
- Database mining is used by companies that want to market new products to their existing customers or by companies that want to attract new customers.
- Database mining is also used to determine which customers are likely to respond to a particular marketing campaign.

# Databse Objects
- Tables: A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
- Views: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
- Indexes: An index is a way to quickly locate data in a database.
- Triggers: A trigger is a set of SQL statements that are automatically executed when a specified event occurs in a database.
- Procedures: A procedure is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed by using a procedure name.
- Functions: A function is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed by using a function name.
- Cursors: A cursor is a database object that enables you to traverse the rows of a result-set one row at a time.
- Constraints: A constraint is a rule that is enforced on a column or a table.
- Rules: Specify acceptable values that can be entered into a table.
- Synonyms: A synonym is an alternative name for a database object.
- Packages: A package is a collection of database objects that can be stored in the database and reused in other packages or applications.
- Database Links: A database link is a connection to another database.
- Sequences: A sequence is a database object that generates a series of numbers.
- Types: A type is a collection of attributes that define the structure of a table.
- Domains: A domain is a collection of values that define the structure of a column.
- Operators: An operator is a symbol that tells the database how to perform a calculation.
- Expressions: An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that results in a value.
- Clusters: A cluster is a group of database objects that are stored together on disk.
# Authentication Methods
- Windows Authentication: Windows Authentication is a method of authentication that uses the Windows operating system to verify the identity of a user.
# Create a Data Model From gathered Requirements:
- Identify the entities
- Identify the relationships
- Identify the attributes of each entity
- Identify the primary key of each entity
- Identify the foreign key of each entity
- some concepts: 
1 - Entity: An entity is a person, place, object, or event about which data is stored.
2 - Attribute: An attribute is a characteristic of an entity.
3 - Relationship: A relationship is a connection between two or more entities.
4 - Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
5 - Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row/record in another table.
